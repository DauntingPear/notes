## Plant Roots and Shoots
- Refer to learning objectives on ppt. and notes
- Know the two principal types of root systems
- Become familiar with overall organization of the root and the early stages of development of a root

- Become familiar with overall organization of the shoot and primary structure of the stem
- Compare and contrast monocots and dicots, including external and internal organization of stems and roots.
- Be prepared to diagram a monocot root and stem and a dicot root and stem including labels
- Know the cellular components of phloem and xylem
- Be familiar with some examples of specialized roots, stems and leaves

## Photosynthesis
- Be familiar with the “what, where, why” of photosynthesis.  Specifically, what is occurring, where is it occurring, why does it occur.
- Be prepared to understand the flow of e- during the process of photosynthesis
- Be prepared to diagram and label the process from a hierarchical level (whole plant to cell and tissue level)

## GENETICS AND INHERITANCE 
- Compare and contrast asexual and sexual reproduction
- Understand the processes of mitosis and meiosis and how they relate to asexual and sexual reproduction / refer to mitosis/meiosis comparison worksheet
- Understand how traits are inherited in plants (basic Mendelian genetics)
- Be prepared to complete Punnett square analysis of plant crosses
- Become familiar with some examples of non-Mendelian inheritance (epistasis, mutations, linkage)

## EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF PLANTS
- Be prepared to diagram the life cycle of plants representing seedless non-vascular, seedless vascular, vascular seed plants and vascular flowering plants.
- Be prepared to discuss adaptations found in each evolutionary grouping that makes the plant increasingly adapted to life on land (and present this information in the form of a cladogram)

## FLOWERS, FRUITS AND SEEDS
- Seeds: be familiar with the basic differences between monocot and dicot seeds.  Know strategies for seedling inhibition of germination.  
- Be prepared to diagram a flower and label flower parts
- Define the different categories of “fruit”

## EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF PLANTS
- Be prepared to diagram the life cycle of plants representing seedless non-vascular, seedless vascular, vascular seed plants and vascular flowering plants.
- Be prepared to discuss adaptations found in each evolutionary grouping that makes the plant increasingly adapted to life on land (and present this information in the form of a cladogram)

## PLANT ECOLOGY
- Refer to learning objectives on posted lecture material
- Be able to describe the State Natural Area Program in Wisconsin [http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/) 
- Define biological community and discuss how biological communities change over space and time
- Define ecotone and provide example (Tension Zone is Wisconsin could be described as an Ecotone, why, what is interesting about biodiversity at ecotones?)
- Be prepared to list, describe and locate on a map of Wisconsin, the geological and climatic factors that create the land divisions in Wisconsin (see posted lecture material).
- Be prepared to describe the plant communities discussed in class including example plant species, soil properties and other pertinent information (see posted lecture material)
- Define “ecological landscape” and why they are used to categorize land [http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/landscapes/](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/landscapes/). 
- Be prepared to identify the ecological landscape of the location you selected and describe this ecological landscape.
